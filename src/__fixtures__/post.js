    "I almost always shower with my socks on. It just feels more relaxing, I don’t really like the feeling of water below my feet. Having socks on, even light ones, feels like a nice towel to put around my feet when I’m showering. It’s just better this way. I’ve done this since I was like, 8, and I don’t ever plan on changing it. When I told my friends about it they all said it was really weird. I just think it is more comfortable, relaxing, and overall a better experience.\n\nEdit: jeez I really didn’t think that this was a big deal.\n\nEdit 2: To address some things:Yes, I actually do this, I personally like it, and it really isn’t problematic so I do it. My feet aren’t always super clean but I rub lotion on them occasionally.\n\nEdit 3: well I went to sleep, and now I have 953 notifications.",
